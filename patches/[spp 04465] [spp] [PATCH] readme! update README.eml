 ## Architecture Overview
 
-The framework is composed of a primary DPDK application that is
-responsible for resource management and secondary processes as workers
-for packet forwarding. This primary application doesn't
-interact with any traffic, and is used to manage creation and freeing of
-resources only.
-
-A Python based management interfaces, `spp-ctl` and `SPP CLI`,
-are provided to control the primary DPDK application to create resources,
-which are then to be used by secondary applications.
-
-This management application provides a socket based interface for
-the primary and secondary DPDK applications to
-interface to the manager.
+SPP is a kind of DPDK
+[multi-process application](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/prog_guide/multi_proc_support.html).
+It is composed of primary process which is responsible for resource
+management, and secondary processes as workers for packet forwarding.
+This primary process does not interact with any traffic. It is
+responsible for creation and freeing of resources shared among other
+secondary processes.
+
+A Python based management interface called SPP controller consists of
+`spp-ctl` and `SPP CLI`.
+`SPP CLI` is a command line interface of SPP, and `spp-ctl` a backend
+server for managing primary and secondary processes.
+`spp-ctl` behaves as a REST API server and `SPP CLI` sends a command via
+the REST API.

 ## How to Use
 
-You should keep in mind the order of launching processes. Primary process must
-be launched before secondary processes. `spp-ctl` need to be launched before
-`spp.py`, but no need to be launched before other processes.
-In general, `spp-ctl` should be launched first, then `spp.py` and `spp_primary`
-in each of terminals without running as background process.
+You can use SPP from `bin/start.sh` script or launching each of
+processes manually. This startup script is provided for skipping to
+input many options for multiple DPDK applications.
+
+### Quick Start
+
+Start with `bin/start.sh` with configuration file `bin/config.sh`.
+First time you run the startup script, it generates the config file
+and asks to edit the config without launchin processes.
+
+Here is a part of config parameters. You do not need to change most of
+params.
+If you do not have physical NICs on your server, activate
+`PRI_VHOST_IDS` which is for setting up vhost interfaces instead of
+physical.
+
+```sh
+SPP_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1
+SPP_HUGEPAGES=/dev/hugepages
+
+# spp_primary options
+LOGLEVEL=7  # change to 8 if you refer debug messages.
+PRI_CORE_LIST=0  # required one lcore usually.
+PRI_MEM=1024
+PRI_MEMCHAN=4  # change for your memory channels.
+NUM_RINGS=8
+PRI_PORTMASK=0x03  # total num of ports of spp_primary.
+#PRI_VHOST_IDS=(11 12)  # you use if you have no phy ports.
+```
+
+After you edit configuration, you can launch `spp-ctl`,
+`spp_primary` and `SPP CLI` from startup script.
+
+```sh
+$ ./bin/start.sh
+Start spp-ctl
+Start spp_primary
+Waiting for spp-ctl is ready ...
+Welcome to the SPP CLI. Type `help` or `?` to list commands.
+
+spp >
+```
+
+Check status of `spp_primary` because it takes several seconds to be
+ready. Confirm that the status is `running`.
+
+```sh
+spp > status
+- spp-ctl:
+  - address: 127.0.0.1:7777
+- primary:
+  - status: running
+- secondary:
+  - processes:
+```
+
+Now you are ready to launch secondary processes from `pri; launch`
+command, or another terminal.
+Here is an example for launching `spp_nfv` with options from
+`pri; launch`. Log file of this process is created as
+`log/spp_nfv1.log`.
+
+```sh
+spp > pri; launch nfv 1 -l 1,2 -m 512 -- -n 1 -s 127.0.0.1:6666
+```
 
-It has a option -b for binding address explicitly to be accessed from other
-than default, `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.
+This `launch` command supports TAB completion. Parameters for `spp_nfv`
+are completed after secondary ID `1`.
 
+```sh
+spp > pri; launch nfv 1
 
-### SPP Controller
+# Press TAB
+spp > pri; launch nfv 1 -l 1,2 -m 512 -- -n 1 -s 127.0.0.1:6666
+```
+
+It is same as following options launching from terminal.
+
+```sh
+$ sudo ./src/nfv/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/spp_nfv \
+    -l 1,2 -n 4 -m 512 \
+    --proc-type secondary \
+    -- \
+    -n 1 \
+    -s 127.0.0.1:6666
+```
+
+Parameters for completion are defined in `SPP CLI`, and you can find
+parameters with `config` command.
+
+```sh
+spp > config
+- max_secondary: "16"   # The maximum number of secondary processes
+- prompt: "spp > "  # Command prompt
+- topo_size: "60%"  # Percentage or ratio of topo
+- sec_mem: "-m 512" # Mem size
+...
+```
+
+You can launch consequence secondary processes from CLI.
+
+```sh
+spp > pri; launch nfv 2 -l 1,3 -m 512 -- -n 2 -s 127.0.0.1:6666
+spp > pri; launch vf 3 -l 1,4,5,6 -m 512 -- -n 3 -s 127.0.0.1:6666
+...
+```
+
+### Startup Manually
+
+You should keep in mind the order of launching processes if you launch
+processes without using startup script.
+`spp-ctl` should be launched before all of other processes. Then,
+primary process must be launched before secondary processes.
+On the other hand, you can launch SPP CLI `spp.py` in any time
+after `spp-ctl`. In general, `spp-ctl` is launched first,
+then `spp.py`, `spp_primary` and secondary processes.
+
+It has a option -b for binding address explicitly to be accessed from
+other than default, `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.
+
+In the following example, processes are launched in different terminals
+for describing options, although you can launch them with
+`pri; launch` command.
